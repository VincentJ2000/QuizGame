The design for the pages are clear and consistent. We used minimal amount of colours which are consistent for all of the pages. Each page is also not overcrowded with buttons, containers and content making it easier for user to use it. The website is also responsive and work on different devices. The navigation between pages are very easy, to make it easier to come back to dashboard. The user can click the logo in the nav bar. Feedback is also provided for the users whenever there is an error and if anything is copied to clipboard. Performance is great since it is a one page website so no lag.
